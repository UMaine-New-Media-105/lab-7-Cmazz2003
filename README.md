Exercise 1 - We had to create an X on the canvas using nested loops for a shape of our choosing https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/tP_29JASE
Exercise 2 - We were supposed to create a grid of shapes on the canvas and give it a gradient, however, I didn't get that far.
Exercise 3 - We were supposed to duplicate the previous sketch and add mouse functionality so that when the user clicks the mouse something changes. However, I didn't that far.
